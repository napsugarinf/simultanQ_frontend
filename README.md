# SimultanQ

## This is the frontend of my final thesis at University using the Angular Framework.

The topic of my thesis is to implement an interactive quiz game without restricting the number of participating players using a web application. Quiz games are extremely popular nowadays and offer numerous advantages. People enjoy challenges, especially when presented in a playful form. Live quiz games provide an exciting and interactive experience as they allow players to compete with each other and test their knowledge. The multiplayer mode facilitates all of this. The fact that players participate simultaneously in the quiz game and there is the possibility of real-time tracking of results makes the game even more thrilling and can have a community-building impact.

The name of my application is "SimultanQ," which aims to represent this concept. "Simultan" refers to shared, simultaneous activities, while the suffix "Q" stands for "Quiz." Analyzing existing online and freely accessible similar applications reveals that the number of participants is limited during the game. Within the scope of this project, a web application has been developed without such restrictions. Users can easily register, create quizzes after logging in, and start the game in a straightforward manner. They can enable players to join the quiz by sharing a PIN code, and the players can access the questions based on this information.

The application contributes to the realization of beloved challenges, the implementation of engaging games in various topics for different groups, testing knowledge, and the competitive approach can provide a genuine team-building experience.
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.0.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
